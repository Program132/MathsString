# Project

This repository is to get an integer number from math calculations that are placed in a variable of type string. 
The program will check the classic operators: +, -, * and /.

Parentheses are not affected here and may even cause problems so in the current version, no parentheses are allowed!

# Installation

I advise you to download or copy the ``main.cpp`` file and past it in your project, everyone can use it!

# F.P.L

This project is made at the base for F.P.L, this system will be implemented in F.P.L
